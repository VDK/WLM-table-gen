WLM-table-gen
=============

This is a small script to generate Wiki tables of _gemeentelijke monumenten_ out of a MySQL database. It also features a geocoding option. It might get bigger if I choose to expand it with queries to the Kadaster database.

There is a OUTDATED step-by-step guide in Dutch here:
